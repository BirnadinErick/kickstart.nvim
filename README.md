# my.nvim

> my own config based on kickstart.nvim

following are what i need:

- lsp
- filetree
- autofmt
- telescope for file search, symbols
- yank/paste from system clipboard
- seperate clipboard

following are the development area i want to use this for:

- c for native app dev
- cpp w/ platform-io cli for embedded dev
- python for cross-platform automation
- sh for personal workstation automation
- zig development (learning) for embedded systems
- rust development (learning) for embedded systems

_any features other than this is not configured or if kickstart.nvim has then not properly looked after_
